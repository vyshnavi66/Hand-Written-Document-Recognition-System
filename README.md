# Hand-Written-Document-Recognition-System

In this assignment, I developed/ integrated existing frameworks to create—a system
capable of:
1. Automatically detect and extract handwritten text regions from a given image.
2. Converting the identified handwritten text into machine-readable text.
3. Conducting a preliminary evaluation of the system’s performance.

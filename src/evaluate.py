def evaluate_ocr(ground_truth_path, recognized_text_path):
    """
    Evaluates OCR performance using CER and WER.

    Args:
    ground_truth_path (str): Path to the file containing ground truth text.
    recognized_text_path (str): Path to the file containing recognized text.
    
    Returns:
    None

    Character Error Rate (CER):

Measures the ratio of errors (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to the total characters.
â€‹
 
Word Error Rate (WER):

Similar to CER but considers words instead of characters.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score:

Useful for binary metrics, e.g., detecting whether text regions were correctly identified.
